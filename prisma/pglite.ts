/**
 * Script that starts a postgres database using pg-gateway (https://github.com/supabase-community/pg-gateway) and pglite (https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite).
 *
 * We use this database for local development with prisma ORM. The script also supports creating a `shadow-database`, which is a second, separate database
 * that prisma uses for certain commands, such as `pnpm prisma migrate dev`: https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database.
 *
 * To make use of the shadow-database add `/prisma-shadow` to the DSN you provide. This script will then spin up a second, in-memory-only database and connect you to it.
